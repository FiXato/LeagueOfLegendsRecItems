### Recommended Items for League of Legends
This repository will contain my _recommended items_ for League of Legends champions as I play with them.
The ini files are built per instructions of http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Recommended_item_code with my own additions such as comments showing the statistics of each item, as well as total costs.
Manually adding these should help with seeing if any stats are missing for a character build.

### Installation Instructions
Find the directory where you've installed League of Legends (for instance `G:\Games\League of Legends\`) and go down to the `RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.0.174\deploy\DATA` directory and clone this repository there as 'Characters':
```
$ cd G:\Games\League of Legends\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.0.174\deploy\DATA
$ git clone git://github.com/FiXato/LeagueOfLegendsRecItems.git Characters
```

Please don't comment on how the selected items suck; just fork the project if you think you can do better. ;-)
